feat(logger): enhance logger plugin with granular control

Add ability to control logging for specific events individually by making the `enabled` option accept either a boolean or an object with event-specific flags. Also added new `onValidationError` hook and bumped version to 1.1.0.

chore: update dependencies across multiple packages
