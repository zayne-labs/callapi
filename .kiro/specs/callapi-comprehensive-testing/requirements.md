# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CALLAPI package is a sophisticated fetch wrapper that provides advanced features like request deduplication, retries, interceptors, validation, plugins, streaming, authentication, URL handling, and comprehensive configuration options. Currently, the package lacks comprehensive test coverage, which poses risks for reliability and maintainability. This feature aims to create a complete test suite that covers all major components, edge cases, and integration scenarios to ensure the package works correctly across different use cases.

## Requirements

2. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL achieve at least 90% code coverage across all source files
3. WHEN edge cases occur THEN the tests SHALL verify proper error handling and fallback behavior
4. WHEN different configurations are used THEN tests SHALL validate that all options work as expected
5. WHEN the main entry points are tested THEN tests SHALL verify createFetchClient and callApi function correctly with various parameter combinations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the CALLAPI package, I want organized test files so that I can easily understand what functionality is being tested and add new tests as features are developed.

2. WHEN looking at test files THEN each SHALL focus on a specific module or functionality area
3. WHEN tests are written THEN they SHALL use descriptive names that clearly indicate what is being tested
4. WHEN test utilities are needed THEN they SHALL be created in shared helper files to avoid duplication
5. WHEN mock utilities are required THEN they SHALL be centralized and reusable across test files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to the CALLAPI package, I want tests that validate HTTP interactions so that I can ensure the library correctly handles various network scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP requests are made THEN tests SHALL mock network calls to avoid external dependencies
2. WHEN different HTTP methods are used THEN tests SHALL verify correct request formation and response handling
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN tests SHALL validate proper error propagation and retry behavior
4. WHEN different response types are returned THEN tests SHALL verify correct parsing and data extraction
5. WHEN custom fetch implementations are provided THEN tests SHALL verify they are used correctly
6. WHEN timeout scenarios occur THEN tests SHALL verify proper timeout handling and AbortError creation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the CALLAPI package, I want validation that all advanced features work correctly so that I can rely on features like deduplication, retries, and plugins in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN request deduplication is enabled THEN tests SHALL verify that duplicate requests are properly handled with both "cancel" and "defer" strategies
2. WHEN retry logic is configured THEN tests SHALL validate retry attempts, delays, conditions, and different retry strategies (linear/exponential) work as expected
3. WHEN plugins are used THEN tests SHALL verify plugin lifecycle, hook execution, option merging, and plugin setup functions
4. WHEN validation schemas are provided THEN tests SHALL verify request/response validation and error handling
5. WHEN deduplication cache scopes are configured THEN tests SHALL verify local and global cache behavior
6. WHEN retry conditions and status codes are specified THEN tests SHALL verify conditional retry logic

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues with the CALLAPI package, I want tests that cover error scenarios so that I can understand how the library behaves under failure conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP errors occur THEN tests SHALL verify HTTPError instances are created with correct properties and error data
2. WHEN validation fails THEN tests SHALL verify ValidationError instances are created with proper error details and issue formatting
3. WHEN network timeouts happen THEN tests SHALL verify timeout handling and AbortError creation
4. WHEN malformed responses are received THEN tests SHALL verify graceful error handling and fallback behavior
5. WHEN different result modes are used THEN tests SHALL verify error handling behavior matches the expected mode
6. WHEN throwOnError configurations are used THEN tests SHALL verify conditional error throwing behavior

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer using streaming features, I want tests that validate streaming functionality so that I can trust upload and download progress tracking works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming uploads occur THEN tests SHALL verify progress events are emitted correctly with accurate byte counts
2. WHEN streaming downloads happen THEN tests SHALL verify response streaming and progress tracking
3. WHEN stream errors occur THEN tests SHALL verify proper error handling and cleanup
4. WHEN stream hooks are used THEN tests SHALL verify hook execution during streaming operations
5. WHEN forceful stream size calculation is enabled THEN tests SHALL verify total byte calculation works correctly
6. WHEN content-length headers are missing THEN tests SHALL verify fallback size calculation behavior

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer using authentication features, I want tests that validate all authentication methods so that I can trust the auth system works correctly with different authentication patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bearer authentication is used THEN tests SHALL verify correct Authorization header formation
2. WHEN Basic authentication is used THEN tests SHALL verify proper username/password encoding
3. WHEN Token authentication is used THEN tests SHALL verify correct token header formatting
4. WHEN Custom authentication is used THEN tests SHALL verify custom prefix and value handling
5. WHEN authentication values are functions THEN tests SHALL verify async function resolution
6. WHEN authentication is null THEN tests SHALL verify auth header removal
