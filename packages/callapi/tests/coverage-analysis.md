- `stream.ts`: 58.82% statements (Target: 90%+)

### 📝 Type Files (Expected Low Coverage)

- `constants/index.ts`: 0% (empty export file)
- Various type files: 0-7.69% (type definitions only)

## Critical Gaps Analysis

### 1. Stream.ts Coverage Gap (58.82%)

**Uncovered Lines**: 50-64, 88-89, 93-135, 152, 157-158

**Missing Test Coverage**:

- Upload progress tracking with accurate byte counts
- Download progress tracking with response streaming
- Stream size calculation with and without Content-Length headers
- Stream interruption and error handling scenarios
- Memory management during large stream operations
- Streaming with different content types and encodings
- Stream utility functions and edge cases

**Impact**: High - Streaming is a core feature for file uploads/downloads

**Recommendation**: Complete Task 11 (Create dedicated streaming functionality tests)

### 2. Retry.ts Coverage Gap (83.78%)

**Uncovered Lines**: 9-18, 131-132

**Missing Test Coverage**:

- Default retry status codes lookup function (lines 9-18)
- Some edge cases in retry strategy creation (lines 131-132)

**Impact**: Medium - Most retry functionality is well tested

**Recommendation**: Add tests for uncovered utility functions and edge cases

## Requirements Coverage Analysis

### ✅ Fully Covered Requirements

- **1.1**: Core functionality testing - Comprehensive coverage across all main features
- **1.3**: Edge case testing - Extensive edge case coverage in multiple test files
- **2.1**: Test infrastructure - Well-organized test structure with helpers and mocks
- **2.4**: Mock utilities - Centralized fetch mocking system
- **3.2**: HTTP method handling - Complete coverage in client and URL tests
- **4.1-4.6**: Advanced features - Deduplication, retry, hooks, plugins all well tested
- **5.1-5.6**: Error handling - Comprehensive error scenario coverage
- **7.1-7.6**: Authentication - All auth methods thoroughly tested
- **8.1-8.6**: URL processing - Complete URL and parameter handling coverage
- **9.1-9.6**: Validation - Comprehensive schema validation testing
- **10.1-10.6**: Result processing - All result modes and response types covered
- **11.1-11.6**: Utility functions - Extensive utility function testing

### ⚠️ Partially Covered Requirements

- **6.1-6.6**: Streaming functionality - Basic streaming hooks tested but dedicated streaming tests missing

## Performance Analysis

### Test Execution Performance

- **Total Time**: 4.50s for 485 tests
- **Average per test**: ~9.3ms per test
- **Setup time**: 936ms (reasonable for mock setup)
- **Collection time**: 4.95s (type checking included)

### Performance Optimizations Applied

- Fake timers for retry delay testing
- Efficient mock reset between tests
- Minimal test setup complexity
- Focused test scenarios with clear inputs/outputs

## Quality Metrics

### Test Organization Quality ✅

- 12 focused test files, each covering specific functionality
- Clear describe blocks for different scenarios
- Descriptive test names explaining what's being tested
- Consistent beforeEach/afterEach setup and cleanup

### Test Data Quality ✅

- Simple, reusable mock data objects
- Clear test scenarios with obvious inputs/outputs
- Centralized fetch mocking utilities
- Minimal test setup complexity

### Assertion Quality ✅

- Custom assertion helpers for common patterns
- Comprehensive error checking
- Proper async/await handling
- Clear expectation messages

## Uncovered Edge Cases and Limitations

### 1. Stream.ts Limitations

- **Large file streaming**: No tests for memory management with very large files
- **Network interruption**: Limited testing of stream interruption scenarios
- **Content encoding**: No tests for different content encodings (gzip, deflate)
- **Concurrent streams**: No tests for multiple simultaneous streams

### 2. Retry.ts Limitations

- **Invalid strategy handling**: Limited testing of invalid retry strategy inputs
- **Extreme delay values**: Edge cases with very large or negative delay values
- **Memory leaks**: No testing for memory leaks in long retry sequences

### 3. Integration Limitations

- **Plugin + Streaming**: Limited testing of plugins with streaming functionality
- **Validation + Streaming**: No tests combining schema validation with streaming
- **Auth + Streaming**: Limited testing of authentication with streaming uploads

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Complete Task 11**: Create dedicated streaming functionality tests to improve stream.ts coverage from 58.82% to 90%+
2. **Enhance retry tests**: Add tests for uncovered retry.ts lines to reach 90%+ coverage
3. **Add streaming integration tests**: Test streaming with other features (auth, validation, plugins)

### Future Improvements (Medium Priority)

1. **Performance benchmarking**: Add performance regression tests for large payloads
2. **Memory leak testing**: Add tests to verify proper cleanup in long-running scenarios
3. **Browser compatibility**: Add tests for browser-specific streaming behaviors
4. **Error recovery**: Enhanced testing of error recovery in complex scenarios

### Monitoring (Low Priority)

1. **Coverage regression**: Set up CI checks to prevent coverage drops below 90%
2. **Performance monitoring**: Track test execution time trends
3. **Flaky test detection**: Monitor for intermittent test failures

## Conclusion

The CALLAPI package has excellent test coverage at 93.46% overall, meeting the 90%+ target. The test suite is well-organized, performant, and covers all major functionality comprehensively.

The primary gap is in streaming functionality (stream.ts at 58.82% coverage), which requires completing the dedicated streaming tests. Once this is addressed, the package will have robust, production-ready test coverage across all features.

All critical paths, error scenarios, and requirements are covered except for the streaming functionality gap. The test infrastructure is solid and ready for ongoing development and maintenance.
