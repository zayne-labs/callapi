description: Learn how to use CallApi with various higher order libraries and frameworks
---

CallApi is designed to be flexible and can be easily integrated with various JavaScript libraries and frameworks. Since it's built on top of the native Fetch API, it works well with any library that expects a Promise-based HTTP client.

## Common Integration Pattern

Most integrations follow a similar pattern:

1. Create a CallApi instance with your base configuration
2. Use the instance in your data fetching hooks or functions
3. Handle errors appropriately using CallApi's error handling utilities

Here's a comprehensive example showing the common integration pattern:

```ts title="example.ts"
import { createFetchClient } from "@zayne-labs/callapi";
import { isHTTPErrorInstance } from "@zayne-labs/callapi/utils";

const callMainApi = createFetchClient({
	baseURL: "https://api.example.com",
	resultMode: "onlyData", // Return just data, not { data, error, response }
	throwOnError: true, // Libraries like React Query expect thrown errors
});

// React Query
const queryResult = useQuery({
	queryKey: ["user", userId],
	queryFn: () => callMainApi(`/users/${userId}`),
});

// SWR
const swrResult = useSWR(`/users/${userId}`, () => callMainApi(`/users/${userId}`));
```
